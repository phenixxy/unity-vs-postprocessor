# Unity VS Postprocessor
A post-processor to customize Visual Studio project files of Unity project. Different build configs are added to compile code for different platforms with correct defines and references. So compile errors can be easily checked by VS build.

2. Trigger generation of VS files in Unity.
3. Open VS solution file.
4. You should see different configs in config dropdown menu on VS toolbar.
